 * This contract is used to test the .call failing in FundMe.sol

 * - "Withdraw .call failure throws error"
 * - "Refund .call failure throws error"

 * The reason this contract causes the .call to fail is because it doesn't have a receive()
 * or fallback() function so the withdrawn and refunded ETH can't be accepted
 * but I still need to send funds to allow this contract to pass the "zero balance fails" tests
 * so there is a specific payable function for sending those initial funds initialFunding()
